Complete the files from the hangman project...


1) Branch out from main in your repo
git branch BRANCH_NAME (to create a new branch)
git switch

      (to switch your HEAD to that new branch)

2) copy one of the hangman files to your repo
https://github.com/arieluchka-lectures/hangman_project_100625/tree/main/game_functions

3) add and commit the newly added file
git add ./game_functions/FILE_NAME.py
git commit -m "YOUR MESSAGE HERE"

4) start solving the functions, and commit your progress after every function.

While file unsolved:
    * Solve function *
    git add ./game_functions/FILE_NAME.py
    git commit -m "Added function XXX"

5) After you completed the file, verify all is commited, switch back to main/master, and merge the branch.
git status (to verify there are no changes (all is commited))
git log (to verify you see all the commits you expect)

git switch main/master
git log (verify that main/master has no commits from the branch)

git merge BRANCH_NAME (merge the finished branch back into main
git log (Now we should see the new commits from the branch)

6) Go back to "1)" and do it again for another file
